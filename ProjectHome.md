JsonNetCDF, a Java Library, for loading GRIB/GRIB2/NetCDF data and make queries.

Objective:
NetCDF is a format for storing data in multi-dimension array.
It is highly compressed and suitable for many cases especially for scientific research.
Unfortunately, data in the tables cannot be easily searched and the API is not generally available, so I try to write a small Java library to make queries on it.
This library can also read GRIB/GRIB2 data.
